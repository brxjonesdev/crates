# **Crates** *A collaborative way to share music with meaning.*

## **Overview**

Crates is a music curation app built around vibe-based, collaborative playlists.
You create a mixtape with a theme and aesthetic, then invite friends to suggest tracks that match.
You choose which songs make the final cut and arrange the flow to tell a story.

It’s not just a playlist.
It’s a shared moment, shaped by the people you care about.

## **How It Works**

### 1. **Create a Mixtape**

Set the tone.

* Choose or upload cover art
* Give it a title
* Add a short description or mood
* (Optional) Select tags like *night drive*, *warm rain*, *late summer*, etc.


### 2. **Collect Tracks**

Invite friends to contribute.

* They suggest songs that match the vibe
* They can leave small notes explaining why
* Submissions gather in an inbox for you to review

### 3. **Curate & Arrange**

You stay in control.

* Accept or decline submissions
* Reorder tracks to shape the emotional arc
* Finalize the mixtape when it feels right
